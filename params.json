  "body": "### Introduction\r\nI have been developing custom (Ansible)[https://www.ansible.com/] modules on my windows system using [JetBrains PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). Below I describe some challenges and best practices on the development and how to debug remotely. \r\n\r\nFor information about developing custom modules using Ansible check [here](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/developing_modules.html).\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\nThough Ansible supports configuring Windows systems, Ansible itself [cannot](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_windows.html#reminder-you-must-have-a-linux-control-machine) be run on a windows control machine. If you are developing custom Ansible modules on a Windows Machine you might find it difficult to debug. This can be difficult if you are used to debugging in the IDE. The [test-module](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/hacking/test-module) offers some debug options if you are good with debugging in the Linux console. \r\n\r\nIn this article I explain how to debug using the IDE debugger on a windows system by running the module remotely on a Ansible controller Linux system.\r\n\r\n### Development Environment Setup\r\nBelow is my development environment:\r\n* Development system - Windows 7\r\n* Development IDE - [JetBrains PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)\r\n* Ansible Controller - OpenSuse Linux Machine with Ansible installed. Must have network connectivity with the Development Windows System.\r\n\r\n>Must have a [Professional Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) for remote debugging features. Community edition [does not](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/) support remote debugging. If you have not purchased already You can get a free trial of Professional Edition for 30 days.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
